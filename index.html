        <h2>1. Watch Your Belongings</h2>
        <p>Keep your bags close and never leave them unattended. Airports are busy places, and unattended items can be stolen or flagged as a security concern.</p>

        <h2>2. Be Ready for Security</h2>
        <p>Have your boarding pass and ID ready, and follow TSA rules. This makes the process faster and helps avoid stress or holding up the line.</p>

        <h2>3. Practice Good Hygiene</h2>
        <p>Airports have high-touch areas. Wash or sanitize your hands frequently to avoid getting sick before your trip.</p>

        <h2>4. Stay Close to Your Gate</h2>
        <p>Gate changes and early boarding calls happen often. Staying nearby prevents you from missing important announcements.</p>

        <h2>5. Listen to Announcements</h2>
        <p>Pay attention to intercom messages about flight updates, delays, or emergencies to stay informed and ready to act quickly.</p>

        <h2>6. Keep Important Documents Safe</h2>
        <p>Store your passport, ID, and tickets in a secure travel pouch. Losing them can delay your travel or prevent boarding entirely.</p>

        <h2>7. Pack Smart</h2>
        <p>Avoid overpacking. Pack essential items in your carry-on and label your luggage to make identifying it easier at baggage claim.</p>

        <h2>8. Be Aware of Your Surroundings</h2>
        <p>Keep an eye on people around you, especially in crowded areas like food courts or baggage claim, to avoid scams or theft.</p>

        <h2>9. Avoid Public USB Chargers</h2>
        <p>“Juice jacking” is real—hackers can steal data through USB ports. Use your own charger and plug directly into wall outlets.</p>

        <h2>10. Know Emergency Exits</h2>
        <p>When you arrive, locate the nearest exits and security personnel. In case of an emergency, you’ll know exactly where to go.</p>
